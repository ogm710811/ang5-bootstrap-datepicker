You can contribute to `ang5-bootstrap-datepicker` and help make it even better.
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [](https://).

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue][submit-issue] to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request][submit-pr] with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. [GitHub](https://github.com/ogm710811/ang5-bootstrap-datepicker/issues)
In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using [plunker]. 
- version of Angular used
- version on ang5-bootstrap used
- build system: angular cli, system.js, starter seed used
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduce scenario using [plunker] allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.
